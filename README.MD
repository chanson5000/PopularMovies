# Popular Movies - Stage One
A project for the Android Developer Nanodegree program through Udacity.

## Project Summary
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family.
In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
You’ll build the complete functionality of this app in two stages which you will submit separately.

## API Key
To run this app correctly, you must insert your themoviedb.org API key into the file:
app\src\main\java\com\nverno\popularmovies\util\MovieDbApi.java
